                About me
            </h6>
            <p>
                I am a software engineer passionate about iOS development, blockchains and web development. Over the course of the last two years, which I've spent as a freelance contractor, I worked both with clients and developers from multiple countries. The experiences I've gained encompass various facets of software engineering, including the development of a complex new product from the first line of code as well as smaller debugging jobs and updates to existing iOS apps.

            <p>
                These experiences endowed me with invaluable lessons about intercultural work relationships, communicating with clients, translating their requirements into code and functioning products, estimating reasonable time-frames for new features, and of course, writing clean, readable, and robust code that passes both UI and unit tests and the ultimate test of real-life users interacting with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a freelancer, I often have the freedom and responsibility to choose the technology/architecture/frameworks for an iOS application. By doing this, I learned multiple things about the various trade-offs we all have to make as software developers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside technology and software engineering, I am a student of UI/UX design, usability and psychology. I have a personal interest in culture, society and history (which is amplified by a degree in law), and mainly the transformative power digital products have on all of these fields.
                When I'm not coding or reading I try to travel as much as possible, visiting far off corners of the world and trying to understand what it means to be human.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think we are extremely lucky to be alive in such a unique point in history where the code we write and the products we engineer can positively impact the lives of millions.
